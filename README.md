Simple Blackjack for Python feat. AI Assistant
================

## Getting started

Blackjack is the only card game that I enjoy, and so I thought it would
be a fun task to create a game simulator using Python. Simply download
the code from this repository and launch the game from your terminal
window:

    python simple_blackjack/play_blackjack.py

By default, the player will be given a starting balance of $100.00. To
change this starting amount, launch the game from your terminal with the
desired balance. For example, if a player wanted an intial balance of
$365.00:

    python simple_blackjack/play_blackjack.py 365

## AI Assistant

The game features an AI assitant to help the player decide on actions to
take during the course of the game. Details concenring the model and how
it was trained can be found in the `ai/` directory of this repo. The
assistant can be toggled off (it is on by default) at the beginning of a
game.

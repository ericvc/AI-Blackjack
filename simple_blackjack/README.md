Simple Blackjack for Python
================

## Getting started

Blackjack is the only card game that I enjoy, and so I thought it would
be a fun task to create a game simulator using Python. Simply download
the code from this repository and launch the game from your terminal
window:

    python simple_blackjack/blackjack.py

By default, the player will be given a starting balance of $100.00. To
change this starting amount, launch the game from your terminal with the
desired balance. For example, if a player wanted an intial balance of
$365.00:

    python simple_blackjack/blackjack.py 365

## Coming soon

This code will serve as the game environment for an upcoming
reinforcement machine learning project. The project will train two
decision models: one for deciding an action at each time step (hit/stay)
and another for deciding whether to split a hand when possible.
